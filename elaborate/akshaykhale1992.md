# 👋  Hi, I am Akshay Khale - @akshaykhale1992

I am a FullStack Web-developer from Mumbai working with a Startup as Sr. Software Engineer. My prime expertise include PHP and Javascript but I also like to play around a little with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and Python.

I also spend some time writing articles on [Medium](https://medium.com/@TheAkshayKhale), or share some micro-articles on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheAkshayKhale) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/theakshaykhale/).
